The generated rubric tree needs to judge the performance of the agent on the task.
The following context variables are available to the scorers and can be included in their prompts using jinja2 syntax:
1. `action_history`: A string representation of the actions that the agent took to solve the task.
2. `final_message`: The final message if any that the agent produced as the result of the task.
3. `error_message`: Message describing an error that the agent encountered.
